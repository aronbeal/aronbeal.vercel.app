# Portfolio Starter Kit

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/).

## Local development

- Clone the project, and run `docker/start.sh`
- Once you're connected to the running container, run `yarn dev`
- The `vercel` cli is available in the container for preview builds, see [Vercel deployment docs](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments).
