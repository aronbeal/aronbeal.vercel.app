# Nextra RSS feed fix

This post has to do with fixing my blog issues with the [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) RSS feed.

This is bundled [with the project](https://github.com/shuding/nextra).  The package maintainer [added](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/issues/24) it, and it executes when `package.json` `build` script is called:

```json
// package.json
"build": "node ./scripts/gen-rss.js && next build",
```
Shelling into my container and executing it shows the problem:
```sh
node@684454cad4eb:/usr/src/app$ node ./scripts/gen-rss.js
(node:90) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:90) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection. This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). To terminate the node process on unhandled promise rejection, use the CLI flag `--unhandled-rejections=strict` (see https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode). (rejection id: 1)
(node:90) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
node@684454cad4eb:/usr/src/app$ 
```
It's obviously assuming everything in here is a directory. 

Looking at part the script in question:

```js
// gen-rss.js
 const posts = await fs.readdir(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'pages', 'posts'))

await Promise.all(
    posts.map(async (name) => {
        if (name.startsWith('index.')) return

        const content = await fs.readFile(
        path.join(__dirname, '..', 'pages', 'posts', name)
        )
        const frontmatter = matter(content)

        feed.item({
        title: frontmatter.data.title,
        url: '/posts/' + name.replace(/\.mdx?/, ''),
        date: frontmatter.data.date,
        description: frontmatter.data.description,
        categories: frontmatter.data.tag.split(', '),
        author: frontmatter.data.author
        })
    })
)
```
It's processing everything that doesn't start with `index.`.  We can do better than that - I'm no JS guru, but this is straightforward node programming, although it's going to take some refreshing on `async/await`. 

I'm going to update this to include the following:

- I see the author has included `const { promises: fs, symlinkSync } = require('fs')`.  I want to use promises throughout for fs code, so I'm changing this import to use the [fs promises API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api) throughout:
    ```js
    const fs = require('fs')
    const fsPromises = fs.promises;
    ```
- I'll move the processing of feed items apart from the directory recursion, splitting these methods up to single-responsibility equivalents.
- I'll have the functions return objects to add to the RSS feed, instead of directly adding to a global object, so we're closer to a pure function here (not referencing `feed` in a function where it was not passed).
- I'll add some argument checks, so the functions are making assertions about what was passed them, so we know immediately when we've messed something up.
- I'll document these functions.  Recording intent at the time of writing is important.

Optimally, I'd add tests here as well, but I'm not sure about the testing framework to use here, or if there is one in use already, so that's being deferred for another day.

Finally, I want to add optional chaining into the arguments being indexed for feed items, since any or all of them could be blank:


```js
  return {
    title: frontmatter.data.title,
    url: file_full.replace(/\.mdx?/, ''),
    date: frontmatter?.data?.date ?? false,
    description: frontmatter?.data?.description ?? false,
    categories: frontmatter?.data?.tag?.split(', ') ?? '',
    author: frontmatter?.data?.author ?? false
  }
```

### Final result:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const fsPromises = fs.promises;
const path = require('path')
const RSS = require('rss')
const matter = require('gray-matter')

 * added to the feed.  Currently, returns true if file is a markdown
 * or mdx file.
 * If a directory is passed, returns false.
 * If anything else is passed, throws an error.
 * 
 * @param {string} filepath A path to a file (or directory).
 * @returns {boolean} true if the item is a readable feed file, false otherwise.

  })

    return false;
  }
  // Confirm file is a blog file.
  let ext = path.extname(filepath||'').split('.');
  if (!["md", "mdx"].includes(ext)) {
    return false;
  }
  // Confirm file is readable.
  return (true === await fsPromises.access(filepath, fs.constants.R_OK).catch(err  => {
    console.error(`is_feed_file(): ${filepath} is not accessible!`);
    return false;
  }));
}

let find_feed_items = async (accumulator, name, dirpath) => {
