# PDF Combination Woes

Had some grief this morning trying to combine images into a PDF in OSX.  

This was a task I'd done many times before, opening up the sidebar in preview to show thumbnails for two distinct images (separate windows), and then slowly and deliberately dragging one into the other.  It's worked in the past, but not this time, and I ran into an issue where I could not switch away from the app after doing so, and had to force-quit.

Fortunately, I came across a suggestion for using Automator instead, via Apple support.  The winning combination was "Ask for Finder Items (with allow multiple selection checked)" => "Sort Finder Items" => "New PDF from images".

Final solution is available here: [Create PDF from finder items.workflow](https://github.com/aronbeal/osx_scripts/tree/main/Create%20PDF%20from%20finder%20items.workflow).  Just do a sparse clone (git >= 2.19) to your local machine, to fetch this specific workflow:

```bash
git clone \
  --depth 1  \
  --filter=blob:none  \
  --sparse \
  https://github.com/aronbeal/osx_workflows.git osx_workflows\
;
cd osx_workflows
git sparse-checkout set "Create PDF from finder items.workflow"

```

Or, more simply, just [download the zip](https://github.com/aronbeal/osx_workflows/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and fetch the subfolder out of the items there.

Once you've got it, directly execute - on OSX, it should open up by default in Automator.  Then, just run the automation.
