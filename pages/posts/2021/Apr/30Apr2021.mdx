# Nightly Docker cleanup

This is just a note on Docker cleanup for OSX. I use Docker on a regular basis, which involves a lot of image fetching, image building, residual containers and volumes, and generally just a _lot_ of system cruft.

That's all fine - it's what Docker needs to do what it does, and what it does is _very_ useful. This needs to be mitigated by regular cleanup effort, however, and I don't want to have to worry about that effort happening.

The crux of the cleanup happens in a bash script, which I've got in my home directory, and `launchd`. The relevant bit of the man page:

```bash
> man launchd
# ... output trimmed here ... #
FILES
     ~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user.

# ... output trimmed here ... #
```

A little helpful, but nothing on the actual configuration of these items, unfortunately. I know these are `.plist` files that can be configured by hand like XML documents, because I've worked with them before, which we could do.

To simplify, I'm going to use [Lingon](https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/), which (for now) is free for the purposes I need it for (why something like this isn't baked into OSX, I've no idea).

When I fire it up, I can see that I've got a few in here already:

import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/2021/30Apr2021/lingon.png"
  alt="Lingon screnshot"
  width={1125}
  height={750}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>
