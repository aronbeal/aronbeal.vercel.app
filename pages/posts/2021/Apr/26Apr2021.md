# New DNS name: aronbeal.info

Grabbed a personalized domain name for this site today.  Not really notable, except to mention that I had to do some hunting around for which Registrar to use.  I was thinking about Google Domains to keep things consolidated, but their prices were too high.

I ended up settling on [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), which had a good combination of price and reputation.  They are also based in Portland, Oregon, which is my neck of the woods.
